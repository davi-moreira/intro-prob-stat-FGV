# Congratulations

.font150[
* You now know:
  - Descriptive stats
  - Measurement
  - How experimental and non-experimental research work
  - Probability and Inference
  - Regression
  
* And better: you know how to implement that in R

* Where do we go from here?

# Next Steps
.font150[
* Unfortunately, this is only the tip of the iceberg...

* Every statistical model has assumptions, and you will learn these in Econometrics.

# Next Steps

.font150[
* But I hope this class taught you to not believe in anything without data

* I also hope that even with data, you remain skeptical.

# Next Steps
.font150[
* If you want to work with data analysis, a few tips:
  - Learn Python
  - Learn SQL
  - Check out for courses taught by Davi. He is awesome!

* And the most important advice: **be prepared to keep learning**. Techniques evolve fast, and it is hard to keep up if you don't study.

* Please let me know if I can be of any help. You are always welcome during my office hours!
