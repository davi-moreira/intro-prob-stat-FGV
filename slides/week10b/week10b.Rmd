# Today's Agenda

.font150[
* Conditional Probability

* Monty Hall problem

* Bayes Rule

# Conditional Probability

# Conditional Probability

.font130[
* Sometimes information about one event can help inform us about the likelihood of another event.

* Examples?
]
--
.font130[
* What is the probability of rolling a 5 and then a 6?

* What is the probability of rolling a 5 and then a 6 given that we rolled a 5 first?

* If it is cloudy outside, gives us additional information about likelihood of rain

* If we know that one party will win the House, makes it more likely that party will win certain Senate races
]
---

# Independence

.font150[
* If the occurrence of one event (A) gives us information about the likelihood of another event, then the two events are .orange[not independent]

* .orange[Independence] of two events implies that information about one event does not help us in knowing whether the second event will occur

* For many real world examples, independence does not hold

* Knowledge about other events allows us to improve guesses/probability calculations
]
---

# Independence

.font150[
* When two events are independent, the probability of both happening is equal to the individual probabilities multiplied together

* And what is the probability of one event when it is conditional to each another?
]
---

# Conditional Probability

.font150[
* $P(A | B)$

* _Probability of A given/conditional that B has happened_
]
--
.font150[
* $P(A | B) = \frac{P(A and B)}{P(B)}$

* _Probability of A and B happening (joint) divided by probability of B happening (marginal)_
]
--
.font150[
* Definitions:

  - $P(A and B)$ - joint probability

  - $P(A)$ - marginal probability
]
---

# Conditional Probability

.font150[
* P(rolled 5 then 6) = ?
]
--
.font150[
* P(rolled 5 then 6) = $\frac{1}{36}$

* P(rolled 5 then 6 | 5 first) =  $\frac{P(5 then 6)}{P(5)}$
]
--
.font150[
* $\frac{\frac{1}{36}}{\frac{1}{6}} = \frac{1}{6}$
]
---

# Conditional Probability

.font150[
* The probability that it is Friday and that a student is absent is 0.03. What is the probability that student is absent, given that it is Friday?

* $P(absent | Friday) = ?$
]
--
.font150[
* $P(absent | Friday) = \frac{0.03}{0.2} = 0.15$
]
---

# Conditional Probability

.font150[
* $P(A | B) = \frac{P(A and B)}{P(B)}$

* Also means:

* $P(A and B) = P(A | B) P(B)$

* Just multiply both sides by $P(B)$ to get rid of the denominator
]
---

# Independence

.font150[
* If A and B are independent, then
  - $P(A | B) = P(A) \&  P(B | A) = P(B)$
  
  - $P(A and B) = P(A) \times P(B)$

* If $A|C$ and $B|C$ are independent, then
  - $P(A and B | C) = P(A |C) \times P(B | C)$
]

# Example

.font130[
| Annual income     | Didn't Take Stats    | Took Stats    | TOTAL |
| :---------------- | :------------------- | :------------ | :---- |
| Under 50,00       | 36                   | 24            | 60    |
| 50,000 to 100,000 | 109                  | 56            | 165   |
| Over 100,000      | 35                   | 40            | 75    |
| Total             | 180                  | 120           | 300   |

* What is the probability of any student making over $100,000?
]
--
.font130[
* What is the probability of a student making over $100,000, conditional that she took Stats?
]
--
.font130[
* What is the probability of a having taken Stats, conditional on  making over $100,000?

# A Slightly Harder Example

.font140[
* John's two favourite foods are bagels and pizza. $A$ represents the event he eats bagel for breakfast and $B$ represents the event that he eats pizza for lunch.

* On a random day, the probability John will eat a bagel, $P(A)$, is $0.6$, the probability he will eat pizza is $P(B) = 0.5$, and the conditional probability that he eats a bagel for breakfast, given that he eats pizza for lunch is $P(A|B) = 0.7$

* Based on this information, what is $P(B|A)$, that is, the probability that John will eats pizza for lunch given that he eats a bagel for breakfast?
]

# Step-by-step

.font150[
* P(A) = 0.6; P(B) = 0.5; P(A|B) = 0.7
* P(B|A)?
]
--
.font110[$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \operatorname{and} B)}{P(B)}$$]
--
.font110[$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \operatorname{and} B)}{P(A)}$$]
--
.font110[$$P(A|B) \times P(B) = P(A \operatorname{and} B)$$]
--
.font110[$$P(B|A) \times P(A) = P(A \operatorname{and} B)$$]
--
.font110[$$P(A|B) \times P(B) = P(A \operatorname{and} B) = P(B|A) \times P(A)$$]
--
.font110[$$0.7 \times 0.5 = 0.35 = P(A \operatorname{and} B) = P(B|A) \times 0.6$$]
--
.font110[$$\frac{0.35}{0.6} = P(B|A) \approx 0.58$$]
---

# Let's See that Again

.font150[
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \operatorname{and} B)}{P(B)}$$
$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \operatorname{and} B)}{P(A)}$$
$$P(A|B) \times P(B) = P(A \operatorname{and} B) = P(B|A) \times P(A)$$
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}$$

# Bayes' Theorem

.font150[
* $P(A)$ = prior probability

* $P(A | B)$: posterior probability of event $A$ given observed data $B$

* $P(B | A)$: probability of observing $B$ given $A$

* $P(B)$: probability of observing $B$.... including both true and false positives!

# Medical Test

.font150[
* Imagine you have a serious disease. It is a rare disease, it happens only to 0.1% of the population. The test identifies the disease correctly in 99% of the cases, but incorrectly in 1% of them. If your test is positive, what is the probability you actually have the disease?
]

# Medical Test

.font150[
$$P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}$$
$$P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|H^c) \times P(H^c)}$$
$$P(disease|test+) = \frac{P(test+|disease) \times Prior(disease)}{P(test+) = \operatorname{true and false positives}}$$

# Medical Test

* Imagine you have a serious disease. It is a rare disease, it happens only to 0.1% of the population. The test identifies the disease correctly in 99% of the cases, but incorrectly in 1% of them. If your test is positive, what is the probability you actually have the disease?
]
--
$$P(H|E) = \frac{.99 \times .001}{.001 \times .99 + .999 \times .01} \approx .09 \approx 9\%$$
---

# Medical Test

.font150[
* Out of 1,000 people, 1 will actually have the disease

* But 10 people will be tested positive _and will not have the disease_

* Which means that 11 people will be tested positive overall

* So we have $\frac{1}{11} \approx .09 \approx 9\%$
